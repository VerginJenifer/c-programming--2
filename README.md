## AIM:
Write a C program to initialize the value as 0 & display the same.
## ALGORITHM:
1. Includes the standard input-output header file #include <stdio.h>.
2. Defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program.
3. Initialize a variable to  0.
4. Uses printf to print the variable to the console.
5. Returns 0, indicating that the program executed successfully.
## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a=0;
    printf("%d",a);
    return 0;
}
```
